Example usage of Google Guava's EventBus: http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/EventBusExplained

From Google's site,
> "EventBus allows publish-subscribe-style communication between components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another (and thus be aware of each other). It is designed exclusively to replace traditional Java in-process event distribution using explicit registration. It is not a general-purpose publish-subscribe system, nor is it intended for interprocess communication."
